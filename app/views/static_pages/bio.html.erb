	<h1>Biography</h1>
	<p><br /></p>
	<div>
		<div>
		  <p>I currently live in the Minneapolis area working for 3M Digital Oral Care. I’m the senior engineer responsible for the post-scan digital data operations and the medical hardware manufacturing operations. I previously worked at the Lexington location for Brontes Technologies, a MIT/Harvard start-up acquired by 3M, to work with the R&D team to commercialize the COS product and reducing manufacturing costs.  <br /></p>
		  <p><br /></p>
		  <p>I am currently interested in start-ups/building new businesses, improving business efficiency to maximize profits, and developing innovative but pragmatic solutions to solve problems.  Side projects include this website, understanding Rails, and playing with hardware.  <br /></p>
		  <p><br /></p>
		  <p>My passions include figuring and knowing how things in the world works, creating new products, cooking good food, and drinking a good beer.  Most of all though, I strive to live life to its fullest with friends and family and make a positive mark in people's lives.<br /></p>
